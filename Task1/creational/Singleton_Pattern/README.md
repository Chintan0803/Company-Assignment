# Singleton Pattern - Database Connection Pool

## Pattern Overview
The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

## Use Case - Database Connection Pool
In this implementation, the DatabaseConnectionPool class manages connections to a database. Only one instance of the connection pool is created to ensure efficient resource usage and to manage all database connections in a thread-safe manner.

### Key Concepts:
- DatabaseConnectionPool: The singleton class that controls database connections.

This use case demonstrates the Singleton Pattern's ability to manage shared resources, such as database connections, ensuring that only one instance of the pool is created.
