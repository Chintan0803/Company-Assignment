# Bridge Pattern - Remote Control for Devices

## Pattern Overview
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be changed independently. This pattern is especially useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between the abstraction and the implementation.

## Use Case - Remote Control for Devices
In this example, a RemoteControl class is the abstraction, while different devices like TV and Radio represent concrete implementations. The Bridge allows us to extend the remote control interface (e.g., by adding advanced controls) without altering the actual devices.

### Key Concepts:
- Device (TV, Radio): These represent the concrete implementations that can be controlled.
- RemoteControl (Abstraction): This interface allows for device control.
- AdvancedRemoteControl: Extends the basic remote control to add additional features like volume control.

This example demonstrates how the Bridge Pattern can separate device control logic from device-specific operations, allowing for future extensibility in both the devices and the remotes.
